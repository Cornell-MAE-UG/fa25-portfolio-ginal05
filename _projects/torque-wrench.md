For my Mechanics of Materials class, I was tasked to design a torque wrench that met the following specifications:
* attain at least 1.0 mV/V output at the rated torque of 600 in-lbf.
* safety factor of X_O = 4 for yield or brittle failure (you pick which criterion based on whether you are using a brittle or ductile material)
* safety factor of X_K = 2 for crack growth from an assumed crack of depth 0.04 inches (1 mm).
* fatigue stress safety factor of X_S = 1.5.
* material must be a steel, aluminum or titanium alloy.

Please see the following PDF for the finalized design and analysis:
