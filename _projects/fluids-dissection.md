As part of my Introduction to Fluid Mechanics class, my group and I dissected a weed wacker, primarily focusing on the carburetor. We described how the cooling turbine, engine, and venturi worked and the fluid mechanics behind the venturi in the carburetor by finding the Mach number, Reynolds Number, velocity, pressure, etc. 

My main contributions to this project is describing how the cooling turbine worked and drawing certain animations throughout the video. On the side, I wrote part of the script and proofread the script along with the fluid analysis and math.

Please see the video below to view our project!
